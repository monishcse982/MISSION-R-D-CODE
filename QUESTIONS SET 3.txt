1. reverse a single linked list using recursion. typically you do with 3 pointers in iteration but you can do this in recursive way as well. 
2. merge two sorted linked lists using recursion. this problem may sound counter intuitive for recursion but try this
3. given a string with many words, count the frequncy of the given word using recursion. string length is given to you already
4. given a sorted double linked list convert that to Binary Search Tree using prev and next as left and right pointers. (find half, first half = tree , 2nd half = tree the mid element = root)
5. print all permutations from 1 to n numbers.

6. A boy can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, how many ways can he climb n stairs.
SOLUTION : recursive call on n-1


7. Compute weight of all nodes in a tree.
8. Tree traversal, visit all nodes of a tree.
9. sum of elements in an array
10. find element in an unsorted array.
11. factorial., fiboncci
