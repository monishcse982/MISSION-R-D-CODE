1. given a string with comma seperated values(unsorted), create a binary tree

2. same as above but create binary search tree

3. given a binary tree as input write program to check whether its a binary search tree or not

4. given a binary tree with left, right pointers and also parent pointer, given any node write program to find height of the node. root is given as input as well to the function

5. given a binary search tree, where two node values are swapped. fix those two values

6. given inorder and preorder traversal outputs as string as input, create the tree

7. given an array of tuples where each tuple contains value and its root value create the tree. example ([2,1][3,1]) is a tree of three nodes where 1 is root and 2 and 3 are children. its a binary tree

8. given a binary tree (not bst) find the maximum value in the tree. write only recursive version

9. given a single sorted linked list, create a binary search tree from that. tree memory should be allocated

10. given two BST's write function to check whether they are same or not, same means their structure may be different but their values are same
